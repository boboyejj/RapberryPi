# RaspberryPi
A tutorial for Raspberry Pi 4

## Device Introduction
If you want to upgrade your rpi3 to rpi4, remember to double check the new features! Don't be like me who knew nothing new about the rpi4 and cannot even boot it up when I received my new toy.

### USB-C Power
Now rpi 4 doesn't use USB power supply anymore. Instead, it's now using **USB-C** power connector. Luckily, I found my macbook charger (29 W) suprisingly boot it up. However, rpi is sensitive to the power supply. Some users fails to boot their deives up by using macbook charger. So it's better to get one for it.

### Micro HDMI
Although I can boot up my device, I cannot display it. Fine... I would just wait a few more days for the Micro HDMI connector.

## Setup
- install os
- transfer files

## Cmd Line
ifconfig
