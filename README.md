# RaspberryPi
A tutorial for Raspberry Pi 4

## Device Introduction
If you want to upgrade your rpi3 to rpi4, remember to double check the new features! Don't be like me who knew nothing about the new rpi and cannot even boot it up when I received my new toy.

### USB-C Power
Now rpi4 doesn't use USB power supply anymore. Instead, it's now using **USB-C** power connector. Luckily, I found my macbook charger (29 W) suprisingly boot it up. However, rpi is sensitive to the power supply. Some users fails to boot their deives up by using macbook charger. So it's better to get one for it.

### Micro HDMI
Wait, my HDMI cannot fit the port on the rpi4 anymore! Fine... I would just wait a few more days for the Micro HDMI connector.

### 8 GB SD Card
For the new device, it needs at least 8 GB SD card. Or you can choose to install the operating system without the desktop. 

## Setup
- install os
After preparing all the supply, we can start setup the rpi4. 
1. Download the os image
  I prefer to use Raspbian.
- transfer files

## Cmd Line
ifconfig
